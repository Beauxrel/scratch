Q1-1 How many packets did the client send in total?  

* The client sent 4 packets in total. The first packet was sent at 2 seconds, and the last packet was sent at 8 seconds. 
  Each packet is sent at an interval of 2 seconds, and no packet was sent at t = 10 seconds because the client application was stopped at that time.


Q1-2 Open the PCAP files using Wireshark. From the timestamps of packets at the client, what is
the round trip time (RTT) as seen by the client? What is the relationship between the RTT and the
P2P link delay?

* The RTT is 36ms. The RTT is equal to twice the P2P link delay (10ms * 2 = 20ms) plus the processing time at the server and client.
  This matches the console output, which shows the RTT for each packet as 36ms.


Q1-3 What is the data (content) in the payload of each packet? This can be found in the Data field in
Wireshark for any UDP packet. How many bytes did each layer (UDP, IP, PPP) add to the payload?

* The wireshark capture shows a total length of 1054 bytes for each UDP packet. 
  This is made up of 1024 bytes of the application data, 8 bytes of UDP header, 20 bytes of IP header, and 2 bytes of PPP header.

Q1-4 Can you adjust the channel delay in a manner that will lead to a packet collision (between the
packet sent by the client and the echo packet from server)? If yes, give an example of such a channel
delay. If not, then why not?

* You cannot create package collison by adjusting channel delay. This is because PPP is full duplex, which means it provides
  seperate channels for each direction. There are also only two nodes on the link.
